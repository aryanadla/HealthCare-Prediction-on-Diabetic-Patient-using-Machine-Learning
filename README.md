# HealthCare-Prediction-on-Diabetic-Patient-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict diabetes in patients through machine learning techniques, focusing on Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. Leveraging a dataset comprising health parameters, the SVM classifier analyzes and predicts the likelihood of diabetes. The project not only contributes to early diagnosis but also emphasizes the significance of machine learning in healthcare with a Accuracy of 78% for both Training data and Testing data by using the labels like Glucose,BloodPressure,DiabetesPedigreeFunction,Age.
